                <h3>Carbon Shift - Co2 observability dashboard</h3>
                <p><br>Carbon Shift is a project created during a Stockholm hackathon, where our team built a practical dashboard to help 
                    companies make smarter cloud infrastructure decisions. The core idea was to visualize and compare both carbon emissions 
                    and electricity costs across different cloud regions, allowing organizations to better understand the environmental and 
                    financial impact of running their servers. The dashboard aggregates data related to server energy consumption and estimated 
                    CO₂ output, then presents it in a clear, decision-friendly interface. Instead of guessing which region might be more efficient, 
                    users can immediately see how shifting workloads could reduce emissions while also lowering operational costs. Our focus was 
                    usability — making complex sustainability data accessible, actionable, and relevant for real-world business decisions.
                    During the hackathon, we worked intensively on data modeling, API integration, and frontend visualization to create a responsive 
                    prototype within a limited timeframe. Beyond the technical implementation, the project highlighted how software tools can directly 
                    support greener infrastructure choices. Winning the hackathon validated both the concept and execution, showing that 
                    sustainability-driven development can be practical, measurable, and impactful when paired with thoughtful design and collaboration.<br><br></p>

                <h3>MILTON - The AI Code Documentation Generator</h3>
                <p><br>This project was developed during the Cillers x Proxify AI-powered hackathon, where our team collaborated closely with 
                    Peter Sundström, AI & Digital Transformation Manager at SAAB, to explore how AI could streamline highly regulated documentation 
                    workflows. The goal was to design a tool capable of generating structured technical documentation that aligns with strict military 
                    standards, specifically MIL-STD-498. We focused on building an AI-assisted workflow that could interpret requirements, organize 
                    information into compliant document structures, and produce consistent, review-ready drafts. Rather than replacing human expertise, 
                    the system was designed to support engineers by reducing repetitive documentation work while maintaining traceability and clarity. 
                    A key challenge was balancing automation with precision, ensuring outputs followed formal standards and terminology expectations. 
                    During the hackathon, we rapidly prototyped the architecture, prompt strategies, and validation logic needed to simulate real-world 
                    documentation scenarios. The result demonstrated how AI can accelerate complex engineering processes without compromising rigor. 
                    Winning the hackathon highlighted the practical value of combining domain knowledge, structured standards, and modern AI tools to 
                    improve efficiency in environments where accuracy and compliance are critical. <br><br></p>

                <h3>Chas Hack - Our own hackathon</h3>
                <p><br>Together with four fellow students at Chas Academy, we took the initiative to plan and host a student-led hackathon designed 
                    specifically for first-year developers. Our goal was to create an encouraging, hands-on environment where participants could 
                    collaborate, experiment, and gain real experience working under time constraints — similar to professional hackathon settings. 
                    We handled everything from concept planning and scheduling to logistics, communication, and judging structure. The event brought 
                    together over 40 participants who formed teams, developed creative solutions, and presented their projects at the end of the day. 
                    A strong emphasis was placed on teamwork, learning, and confidence-building rather than competition alone. The hackathon turned 
                    into a high-energy day filled with problem-solving, idea sharing, and impressive demos. Many participants stepped outside their 
                    comfort zones, tried new technologies, and practiced pitching their work. Seeing the engagement and enthusiasm confirmed the value 
                    of peer-driven initiatives. The success of the event demonstrated how student leadership, collaboration, and community-building 
                    can create meaningful learning experiences beyond the classroom. <br><br></p>
