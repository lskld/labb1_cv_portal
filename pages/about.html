                <p>I’m a curious fullstack developer in training, focused on C# and .NET, building APIs, backend systems, and databases to sharpen 
                    both my technical skills and problem-solving mindset. I share projects on GitHub as a living journal of learning, experimentation, 
                    and steady improvement. I enjoy collaborating, joining hackathons, and turning ideas into practical, scalable solutions. My goal 
                    is to grow into a reliable, creative developer who delivers real value. I’m driven by curiosity, humor, and the belief that great 
                    software should be thoughtful, maintainable, and a little bit fun to build every single day, while learning, sharing, iterating, 
                    improving, reflecting, evolving. </p>

                <p>I really enjoy sport fishing in Sweden and spend a lot of my free time on the water whenever I can. Fishing for pike, perch, and 
                    rainbow trout is a simple way for me to relax, focus, and enjoy being outdoors. I like trying different lures, learning how fish 
                    behave, and slowly improving my technique. Some days are quiet, others are exciting, but that’s part of the fun. Fishing gives me 
                    a break from screens and routines, and I appreciate the calm, the challenge, and the satisfaction of a good catch, no matter the size.</p>
